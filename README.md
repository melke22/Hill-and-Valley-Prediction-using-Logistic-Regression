# Hill-and-Valley-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
In Google Colab, our objective is to analyze a dataset of 100 points on a 2D graph. Each point has an X-coordinate (1-100) and a binary "Class" (0 or 1) denoting "valley" or "hill." We'll process and visualize this data to reveal terrain-like patterns, aiding data-driven insights.
